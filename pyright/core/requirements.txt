### Requirements: core
#
# This file defines the dependencies for the core pyright environment for the internal repo. This
# is the environment that # pyright/pylance will use by default when running as a language server.
#
# Ideally, this would be the only pyright environment we need to define. This is not possible
# because of dependency conflicts in between Dagster packages/examples. For ease of maintenance,
# this file should maintain a complete list of Dagster packages, with packages excluded from the
# enviroment commented out.
#
# NOTE: It is important that dagster-* dependencies of any package listed here are also listed.
# e.g. if examples/foo depends on python_modules/libraries/dagster-foo, then dagster-foo must be
# listed if examples/foo is listed.
#
# NOTE: Paths are relative to repo root.

### LIBRARIES

-e python_modules/dagster[pyright,test]
-e python_modules/dagster-graphql
-e python_modules/dagster-pipes
-e python_modules/dagster-webserver

### CONSTRAINED BEYOND RUNTIME
# The packages listed here are constrained beyond what is necessary for runtime
# compatibility. Even though Dagster supports a wider range of versions at
# runtime, some of these versions have bugged or incomplete type annotations
# that trigger type errors
