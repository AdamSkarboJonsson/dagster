# Your First Software Defined Asset

Now that we have the raw data files and the Dagster project setup lets create some loading those csv's into duckdb. 

## What you'll learn

- Creating our intial defintions object
- Adding a duckdb resource
- Building some basic software defined assets 

## Building definitions object

The definitions object [need docs reference] in Dagster serves as the central configuration point for defining and organizing various componenets within a Dagster Project. It acts as a container that holds all the necessary configurations for a code location, ensuring that everything is organized and easily accessible. 

1. Creating Definitions Object and duckdb resource

Open the definitions.py file and add the following import statements and definitions object. 

  ```python
  import json
  import os

  from dagster_duckdb import DuckDBResource

  import dagster as dg

  defs = dg.Definitions(
    assets=[],
    resources={"duckdb": DuckDBResource(database="data/mydb.duckdb")},
  )
  ```

## Loading raw data

1. Products Asset

We need to create an asset that creates a duckdb table for the products csv. Additionally we should add meta data to help categorize this asset and give us a preview of what it looks like in the Dagster UI. 

<CodeExample filePath="guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/etl_tutorial/definitions.py" language="python" lineStart="8" lineEnd="33"/>

You'll notice here that we have meta data for the compute kind for this asset as well as making it part of the ingestion group. Additionally, at the end we add the row count and a preview of what the table looks like. 

2. Sales Reps Asset

This code will be very similar to the product asset but this time its focused on Sales Reps.

<CodeExample filePath="guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/etl_tutorial/definitions.py" language="python" lineStart="35" lineEnd="61"/>

3. Sales Data Asset

Same thing for Sales Data

<CodeExample filePath="guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/etl_tutorial/definitions.py" language="python" lineStart="62" lineEnd="87"/>

4. Bringing our assets into the Definitions object

Now to pull these assets into our definitions object simply add them to the empty list in the assets parameter. 

  ```python
  defs = dg.Definitions(
    assets=[products,
        sales_reps,
        sales_data,
    ],
    resources={"duckdb": DuckDBResource(database="data/mydb.duckdb")}
    ),
  ```

## What you've learned

- Created a Dagster Definition
- Built our ingestion assets
