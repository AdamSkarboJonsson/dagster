# Dagster & dbt quickstart

This quickstart will get your dbt project up and running quickly with Dagster. By the end of this guide, you'll have an integrated Dagster and dbt project and be able to view it in the Dagster UI.

<details>
  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A valid dbt project
  - A dbt project must contain the `dbt_project.yml` and `profiles.yml` files
  - A test project like [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dagster-io/jaffle_shop) can be used

</details>

## Step 1: Set up your environment

<Note>
  <strong>Note</strong>: We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a
  Python virtualenv. Refer to the{" "}
  <a href="/getting-started/install">Dagster installation docs</a> for more
  information.
</Note>

Install dbt, Dagster, and the Dagster webserver by running the following:

```shell
pip install dagster-dbt dagster-webserver
```

The `dagster-dbt` library installs both `dbt-core` and `dagster` as dependencies. Refer to the [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) and [Dagster](/getting-started/install) installation docs for more information.

Other requirements based on the dbt project could be needed. In most cases, installing the library that supports your [dbt adapter](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/supported-data-platforms#types-of-adapters) will be required. For instance, `dbt-duckdb` if you are using DuckDB as a dbt adapter.

## Step 2: Create a new Dagster Project

In order to load a dbt project into dagster, we'll first have to create a new Dagster project (if you have a dagster project set up, you can skip this step).

Use `dagster project scaffold` to scaffold a Dagster project.

You'll now have the following structure set up:
```shell
my_dagster_project
├── __init__.py
├── assets.py
├── definitions.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── setup.cfg
└── setup.py
```

## Step 3: Add code to import dbt project

Now, we can import our dbt project. Add a new file `my_dagster_project/dbt_project.py` to your dagster project like so:
```python file=/integrations/dbt/quickstart/with_project.py startafter=start_dbt_project_example endbefore=end_dbt_project_example
   from pathlib import Path

   from dagster_dbt import DbtProject

   proj = DbtProject.from_git(
    "https://github.com/dagster-io/jaffle_shop", 
    output_dir=RELATIVE_PATH_TO_MY_DBT_PROJECT
   )
   ```

In your project's `assets.py` file, add the following code:
```python file=/integrations/dbt/quickstart/with_project.py startafter=start_dbt_assets_example endbefore=end_dbt_assets_example
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, dbt_assets

from .project import proj 

@dbt_assets(manifest=proj.get_manifest())
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```


In your project's `definitions.py` file, include the asset and resource:
```python
from dagster import Definitions
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource

from .project import proj
from .assets import my_dbt_assets

defs = Definitions(
  assets=[..., my_dbt_assets],
  resources={"dbt": proj.get_resource()}
)

With these changes, your Dagster project is ready to run your dbt project.


## Step 4: Run your dbt project in the Dagster UI

Now that your code is ready, you can use the [Dagster UI](/concepts/webserver/ui) to take a look at your dbt project. Use the tabs to view instructions for starting the UI.

1. Change directories to the Dagster project directory:

   ```shell
   cd my_dagster_project/
   ```

2. To start Dagster's UI, run the following:

   ```shell
   dagster dev
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagster-webserver on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

In your browser, navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. The page will display the asset graph for the job created by the schedule definition:

<!--
![Asset graph for your job in Dagster's UI, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets](/images/integrations/dbt/quickstart/asset_graph.png)
-->

<Image
alt="Asset graph for your job in Dagster's UI, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets"
src="/images/integrations/dbt/quickstart/asset_graph.png"
width={2688}
height={1680}
/>

In Dagster, running a dbt model corresponds to _materializing_ an asset. The [schedule definition](/concepts/automation/schedules) included in your Dagster project's code location (<PyObject object="Definitions" /> object) will materialize the assets at its next cron tick.

Assets can also be materialized manually by clicking the **Materialize all** button near the top right corner of the page.
