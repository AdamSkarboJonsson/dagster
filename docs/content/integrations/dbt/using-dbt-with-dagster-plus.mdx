# Using dbt with Dagster+

Importing an existing dbt project in Dagster+ allows you to automatically load your dbt models as Dagster assets. This can be be done with:

- An existing dbt project that is not already using Dagster, or
- A Dagster project in which your dbt project is included

In this guide, we'll demonstrate by using an existing dbt project that doesn't use Dagster.

---

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need **Dagster+ Organization Admin**, **Admin**, or **Editor** permissions. This is required to create a code location.

You'll also need **an existing dbt project** that contains the following files in the repository root:

- [`dbt_project.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml)
- [`profiles.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/profiles.yml)

---

## Step 1: Import your project in Dagster+

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> This guide focuses on Serverless deployments in
  Dagster+, but dbt projects may also be deployed if using a Hybrid deployment.
  For more information about Hybrid deployments, refer to the{" "}
  <a href="/dagster-plus/deployment/hybrid#hybrid-deployments-in-dagster">
    Hybrid deployment documentation
  </a>
  .
</Note>

In this section, we'll demonstrate how to import an existing project Dagster+. Our example imports the project from a GitHub repository, but Dagster+ also supports Gitlab.

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ account.

2. Navigate to **Deployment > Code locations**.

3. Click **Add code location**.

4. Click **Import a dbt project**, then **Continue**.

5. At this point, you'll be prompted to select either GitHub or Gitlab. For this guide, we'll select **GitHub**.

6. You'll be redirected to GitHub, where you'll be prompted to authorize the Dagster+ application. **Note**: The profile or organization you're using to authorize Dagster+ must have read and write access to the repository containing the project.

   After the authorization is complete, you'll be redirected back to Dagster+.

7. In Dagster+, locate and select the repository containing the project by using the dropdowns. **Note**: dbt projects must have `dbt_profiles.yml` and `profiles.yml` files in the repository root or an error will display.

8. Click **Continue**. Dagster+ will begin importing the project and open a pull request to update the repository. This pull request adds a few files, which we'll discuss in the next section.

## Step 2: Review the repository changes

The file structure of the repository will change the first time a project is deployed using Dagster+. For dbt projects, a few things will happen:

- **A [`dagster_cloud.yaml` file](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) will be created.** This file defines the project as a Dagster+ code location.
- **GitHub Action files will be created in `.github/workflows`.** These files, named `branch_deployments.yml` and `deploy.yml`, manage the deployments of the repository.
- **For dbt-only projects being deployed for the first time**, Dagster+ will create a new Dagster project in the repository using the [`dagster-dbt scaffold`](/integrations/dbt/reference#scaffolding-a-dagster-project-from-a-dbt-project) command. This will result in a Dagster project that matches the dbt project. For example, a dbt project named `my_dbt_project` will contain a Dagster project in `my_dbt_project/my_dbt_project` after the process completes. Refer to the [Dagster project files reference](/guides/understanding-dagster-project-files) to learn more about the files in a Dagster project.

**Use the following tabs** to see how the repository will change for a [dbt-only project](#dbt-only-projects) and a [dbt and Dagster project](#dbt-and-dagster-projects) being deployed for the first time.

### dbt-only projects

</Note>

Before the Dagster+ changes, a typical dbt project would include files like `dbt_project.yml`, `profiles.yml`, dbt models in `.sql` format, and sbt seeds in `.csv` format. As this is a git repository, other files like `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` and `README.md` may also be included:

```shell
## dbt-only project
## before Dagster+ deployment

my_dbt_project
├── models
│   ├── my_model.sql
├── seeds
│   ├── my_seeds.csv
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dbt_project.yml
└── profiles.yml
```

When the Dagster+ deployment process completes, the repository will now look like the following:

```shell
## dbt-only project
## after Dagster+ deployment

my_dbt_project
├── .github                                                ## GitHub Action files
│   ├── workflows
│   │   ├── branch_deployments.yml
│   │   ├── deploy.yml
├── models
│   ├── my_model.sql
├── my_dbt_project                                         ## New Dagster project
│   ├── my_dbt_project
│   │   ├── __init__.py

</Note>

After the Dagster+ changes, a dbt and Dagster project will include the files required for dbt and Dagster, some files related to git, and the newly-added Dagster+ files:

#### Update the cloud action files

1. In your Dagster project, locate the .github/workflows directory.

2. Open the deploy.yml file.

3. Locate the Checkout for Python Executable Deploy step, which should be on or near line 38.

4. Add

```
- name: Parse dbt project and package with Dagster project
  if: steps.prerun.outputs.result == 'pex-deploy'
  run: |
    pip install pip --upgrade
    pip install dbt-duckdb
    cd project-repo/analytics
    dbt deps
    dbt parse
  shell: bash
```

[//]: <> "TODO: Add the steps for GitLab as well"

#### Review the state of the repo

When deploying a Dagster project for the first time, the workflow adds various files - a [dagster_cloud.yaml file](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml), if it is missing, and two cloud action files under `.github/workflows`, `branch_deployments.yml` and `deploy.yml`, to manage the deployments of the repository.

After adding the files to the repository, a typical file structure would include the required files for dbt and Dagster, some files related to Git, like `.gitignore`, and the newly added files.

```shell
## dbt and Dagster project
## after Dagster+ deployment

my_dbt_and_dagster_project
├── .github                                                ## GitHub Action files
│   ├── workflows
│   │   ├── branch_deployments.yml
│   │   ├── deploy.yml
├── dbt
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── my_model.sql
│   ├── seeds
│   │   ├── my_seeds.csv
│   ├── dbt_project.yml
│   ├── profiles.yml
├── my_dbt_and_dagster_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── assets.py
│   ├── definitions.py
│   ├── project.py
│   ├── schedules.py
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dagster_cloud.yaml                                     ## Dagster+ code location file
├── pyproject.toml
└── setup.py
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

When deploying a dbt & Dagster project through "Import a Dagster project", the cloud action added to the project repo will require some attention - using dbt requires some additional steps.deployment
