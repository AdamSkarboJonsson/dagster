# Metadata, kinds, and tags

One of the core benefits of Dagster is fostering collaboration between the engineers who build data pipelines and the end users who consume the data pipelines produce.

Dagster offers several ways to provide useful information and documentation alongside your data pipelines, including metadata, kinds, and tagging.

---

## Benefits

Using metadata and tags helps you:

- Create built-in documentation that makes your pipelines easy to understand
- Visually categorize your assets
- Provide useful context for other users of your project (and your future self!)
- Improve the ease of debugging when issues arise
- Organize definitions in your Dagster project and improve filtering in the Dagster UI

## How metadata works

There are two main types of metadata in Dagster: definition and runtime. In code, you can attach metadata to definitions like assets, jobs, and runs. You'll then be able to view the metadata in the Dagster UI.

- **Definition metadata** is information that's fixed or doesn't frequently change. For example, definition metadata could be:

  - The columns an asset is expected to contain
  - A link to source file in Github that contains the code that defines the asset or job

- **Runtime metadata** is information that changes after an action occurs. This could be how many records were processed, how long an asset took to materialize, etc.

How metadata is defined depends on whether you're using assets or ops and jobs:

- [Assets](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata)
- [Op jobs](/concepts/metadata-tags/op-job-metadata)

## How kinds work

Kinds are a way to label and categorize definitions in Dagster. Kinds correspond to prominently displayed icons in our visual tools (see XXX for supported visual kinds) and also can be the target of searches. A good proxy for whether something should be a kind is whether or not it is an adjective in your day-to-day language and meaningfully identifies that definition. E.g. "Is this a dbt asset or a databricks asset?" would indicate that "dbt" and "spark" are kinds for your project.

In its implementation, kinds are system-defined tags, prefixed with the "dagster/" prefix. Our UIs reserve the right to treat these tags specially, hiding them or promoting them as appropriate.

## How tags work

In addition to definition metadata, you can also use tags to annotate and organize definitions in your Dagster project. Definitions like assets, jobs, and runs can have multiple tags, which are applied in code. Refer to the [Tags](/concepts/metadata-tags/tags) documentation to get started.
