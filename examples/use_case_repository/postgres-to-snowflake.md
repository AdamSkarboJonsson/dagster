## Postgres to Snowflake Data Transfer with Dagster Embedded ELT

### Overview

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to transferring data from a Postgres database to Snowflake using Dagster Embedded ELT. The objective is to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process, ensuring data is efficiently moved and transformed as required.

### Prerequisites

Before implementing this use case, ensure you have the following:

- A running instance of Postgres and Snowflake.
- Necessary credentials and access permissions for both databases.
- Installed Python environment with `dagster`, `dagster-embedded-elt`, `dagster-snowflake`, and `sqlalchemy` libraries.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

By following this guide, you will learn how to:

- Configure connections to Postgres and Snowflake.
- Define assets for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- Automate the ETL process using Dagster Embedded ELT.

### Steps to Implement With Dagster

1. **Step 1: Configure Connections**
    - Set up the connections to your Postgres and Snowflake databases using Dagster resources.
    - Define the connection strings and credentials required for both databases.

    Example:
    ```python
    from dagster import Definitions, EnvVar
    from dagster_snowflake import SnowflakeResource
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine

    # Define Snowflake resource
    snowflake_resource = SnowflakeResource(
        account="your_snowflake_account",
        user=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_USER"),
        password=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD"),
        database="your_snowflake_database",
        schema="your_snowflake_schema",
    )

    # Define Postgres connection
    postgres_engine = create_engine("postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database")

    defs = Definitions(
        resources={
            "snowflake": snowflake_resource,
            "postgres": postgres_engine,
        }
    )
    ```

2. **Step 2: Define the Extraction Asset**
    - Create an asset to extract data from the Postgres database.
    - Use SQLAlchemy to query the Postgres database and fetch the required data.

    Example:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from dagster import asset, ResourceParam
    from sqlalchemy import Engine

    @asset
    def extract_data(postgres: ResourceParam[Engine]) -> pd.DataFrame:
        with postgres.connect() as conn:
            query = "SELECT * FROM your_table"
            df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
        return df
    ```

3. **Step 3: Define the Transformation and Loading Asset**
    - Create an asset to transform the extracted data and load it into Snowflake.
    - Use the Snowflake resource to write the transformed data to a Snowflake table.

    Example:
    ```python
    from dagster import asset
    from dagster_snowflake import SnowflakeResource
    from snowflake.connector.pandas_tools import write_pandas

    @asset
    def transform_and_load_data(extract_data: pd.DataFrame, snowflake: SnowflakeResource):
        # Perform any necessary transformations
        transformed_data = extract_data  # Add your transformation logic here

        # Load data into Snowflake
        with snowflake.get_connection() as conn:
            write_pandas(conn, transformed_data, 'your_snowflake_table', auto_create_table=True, overwrite=True)
    ```

### Expected Outcomes

By implementing this use case, you should be able to automate the ETL process from Postgres to Snowflake. The data will be extracted from Postgres, transformed as needed, and loaded into Snowflake, ready for further analysis or reporting.

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure that the connection strings and credentials are correct and that the databases are accessible.
- **Data Transformation Errors**: Verify the transformation logic to ensure it meets your requirements and handles edge cases.
- **Loading Errors**: Check the Snowflake table schema and ensure it matches the structure of the transformed data.
