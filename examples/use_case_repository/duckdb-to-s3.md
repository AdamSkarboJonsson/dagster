## Automating Data Transfer from DuckDB to S3 with Dagster Embedded ELT

### Overview

This use case demonstrates how to transfer data from DuckDB to Amazon S3 using Dagster Embedded ELT. The objective is to automate the extraction of data from DuckDB and store it in S3 for further processing or archival. This guide will walk you through setting up the necessary configurations and implementing the data transfer using Dagster's Embedded ELT capabilities.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A running instance of DuckDB.
- An Amazon S3 bucket where the data will be stored.
- AWS credentials with the necessary permissions to write to the S3 bucket.
- Python installed on your machine.
- Dagster and the `dagster-embedded-elt` library installed.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

By following this guide, you will learn how to:

- Configure Dagster to connect to DuckDB and S3.
- Define assets using Dagster Embedded ELT.
- Automate the data transfer process from DuckDB to S3.

### Steps to Implement With Dagster

1. **Step 1: Install Required Libraries**
    - First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install dagster dagster-embedded-elt
    ```

2. **Step 2: Define the Replication Configuration**
    - Create a YAML file named `sling_replication.yaml` to define the replication configuration:
    ```yaml
    source: 'duckdb://local.duckdb'
    target: 's3://your-bucket-name'
    
    defaults:
      mode: full-refresh
      object: 'main.{stream_file_folder}_{stream_file_name}'
    
    streams:
      "table_name":
        source_options:
          format: parquet
    ```

3. **Step 3: Create the Dagster Assets**
    - Define the assets in a Python file, for example, `assets.py`:
    ```python
    from dagster import file_relative_path, Definitions
    from dagster_embedded_elt.sling import DagsterSlingTranslator, sling_assets
    from dagster_embedded_elt.sling.resources import SlingResource, SlingConnectionResource

    replication_config = file_relative_path(__file__, "sling_replication.yaml")

    @sling_assets(replication_config=replication_config)
    def my_assets(sling: SlingResource):
        yield from sling.replicate(
            replication_config=replication_config,
            dagster_sling_translator=DagsterSlingTranslator(),
        )

    sling_resource = SlingResource(
        connections=[
            SlingConnectionResource(
                name="LOCAL_DUCKDB",
                type="duckdb",
                connection_string="duckdb://local.duckdb",
                duckdb_version="0.9.2",
            ),
            SlingConnectionResource(
                name="AWS_S3",
                type="s3",
                bucket="your-bucket-name",
                access_key_id="your-access-key-id",
                secret_access_key="your-secret-access-key",
            ),
        ]
    )

    defs = Definitions(
        assets=[my_assets],
        resources={
            "sling": sling_resource,
        },
    )
    ```

### Expected Outcomes

After implementing this use case, you should have an automated process that transfers data from DuckDB to Amazon S3. You can verify the success by checking the S3 bucket for the presence of the transferred data in the specified format.

### Troubleshooting

- **Issue:** Data transfer fails with permission errors.
  - **Solution:** Ensure your AWS credentials have the necessary permissions to write to the S3 bucket.

- **Issue:** Incorrect data format in S3.
  - **Solution:** Verify the `sling_replication.yaml` configuration for correct format specifications.
