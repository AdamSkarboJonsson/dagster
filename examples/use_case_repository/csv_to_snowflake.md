## Automating CSV to Snowflake Data Transfer with Dagster

### Overview

This use case demonstrates how to transfer data from a CSV file to Snowflake using Dagster. The objective is to automate the ingestion of CSV data into Snowflake for further processing or analysis. By leveraging Dagster's asset-based approach, you can ensure that your data pipelines are robust, maintainable, and easy to monitor.

### Prerequisites

Before implementing this use case, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Snowflake account with appropriate permissions.
- A CSV file containing the data you want to transfer.
- Environment variables set up for Snowflake credentials (`SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`, `SNOWFLAKE_USER`, `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`).
- Python environment with `dagster`, `dagster_snowflake`, and `pandas` libraries installed.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Define assets in Dagster to read data from a CSV file.
- Configure Snowflake resources in Dagster.
- Load CSV data into Snowflake using Dagster assets.

### Steps to Implement With Dagster

1. **Step 1: Define the CSV Asset**
    - Create an asset to read data from the CSV file using Pandas.
    - Ensure the CSV file is accessible from the script.

    Example:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from dagster import asset, Definitions

    @asset
    def csv_data() -> pd.DataFrame:
        return pd.read_csv("path/to/your/data.csv")

    defs = Definitions(assets=[csv_data])
    ```

2. **Step 2: Configure Snowflake Resource**
    - Set up the Snowflake resource in Dagster using environment variables for credentials.
    - Ensure the Snowflake resource is properly configured to connect to your Snowflake instance.

    Example:
    ```python
    from dagster_snowflake import SnowflakeResource
    from dagster import EnvVar

    snowflake = SnowflakeResource(
        account=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT"),
        user=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_USER"),
        password=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD"),
        warehouse="YOUR_WAREHOUSE",
        database="YOUR_DATABASE",
        schema="YOUR_SCHEMA",
    )
    ```

3. **Step 3: Load CSV Data into Snowflake**
    - Define an asset that takes the CSV data and loads it into Snowflake.
    - Use the Snowflake resource to establish a connection and execute the data load.

    Example:
    ```python
    from snowflake.connector.pandas_tools import write_pandas
    from dagster import asset, MaterializeResult

    @asset(deps=["csv_data"])
    def load_to_snowflake(csv_data: pd.DataFrame, snowflake: SnowflakeResource) -> MaterializeResult:
        with snowflake.get_connection() as conn:
            table_name = "your_table_name"
            success, number_chunks, rows_inserted, output = write_pandas(
                conn,
                csv_data,
                table_name=table_name,
                auto_create_table=True,
                overwrite=True,
                quote_identifiers=False,
            )
        return MaterializeResult(metadata={"rows_inserted": rows_inserted})

    defs = Definitions(assets=[csv_data, load_to_snowflake], resources={"snowflake": snowflake})
    ```

### Expected Outcomes

By following these steps, you will have a fully automated pipeline that reads data from a CSV file and loads it into Snowflake. You can monitor the pipeline's execution and ensure data integrity through Dagster's robust asset management features.

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your Snowflake credentials and network configurations are correct.
- **Data Load Errors**: Verify the CSV data format and ensure it matches the Snowflake table schema.
- **Environment Variables**: Double-check that all required environment variables are set correctly.

### Additional Resources

- [Dagster Documentation](https://docs.dagster.io/)
- [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/)
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)

### Next Steps

After successfully implementing this use case, you can explore more advanced features such as:

- Scheduling the pipeline to run at regular intervals.
- Adding data validation and transformation steps.
- Integrating with other data sources and sinks.

By leveraging Dagster's powerful orchestration capabilities, you can build complex and reliable data pipelines tailored to your specific needs.
