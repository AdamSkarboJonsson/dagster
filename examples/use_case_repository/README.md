## Use Case Repository

These use-cases are read by the dagster.io website to populate a list of available uses cases for our use case repository.

Use cases are fetched via an automated step during the build of the dagster.io website from the master branch of this repository.

Both the markdown and python files are used on our website. Please ensure you update both when making changes. Only the python files are tested.
